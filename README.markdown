# A Pelican theme based on [cebong][cebong] #

I created a theme for the [blog](https://www.nathanmorrison.net/blog/) on my website
based on [cebong][cebong]. I added a top-left nav bar using Pelican's MENUITEMS and a
drop-down menu for categories.

## Original author's description ##

This theme is focused on simplicity and solarized-looks, its structure was derived from the pelican's *notmyidea* theme, and I altered some stuff to look more like [my old tumblr blog](http://kecebongsoft.tumblr.com), which is pretty much solarized-like.
